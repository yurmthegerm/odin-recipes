# odin-recipes
my first odin project: recipes
This is a website of recipes. while making this project, I mainly focus on:
1. creating a repository
2. cloning a repository onto a local machine
3. committing gits
4. working with multiple html files
5. revisiting essential html tags and conventions
6. decorating a website with css
